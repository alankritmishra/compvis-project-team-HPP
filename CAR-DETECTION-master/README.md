CAR-DETECTION
=============

car detection using the UIUC car database

INFO:


This repository consists of 5 cascade classifier files and a c++ file to use these cascade classifiers to detect cars.

The image database can be downloaded from here : http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/Data/Car/

The explanation of code is done with comments.



USAGE:


Download all the cascade file and the c++ file.

You are supposed to have opencv installed in your system.

Keep all the files in a single folder location.

Compile the c++ program in a usual OpenCV compilation way.

Run the code : example : ./car_detect IMAGE.EXTENTION checkcas.xml cas1.xml cas2.xml cas3.xml cas4.xml

Make sure the image also is in the same folder,otherwise while execution you need to give the absolute path of the image.



RESULTS:

The results are truely based on the test images provided by the database.

I do not guarantee perfect results for images other than those test images.

We are still working on increasing the accuracy of the detection and also implementing the execution on general images.



CONTRIBUTION:

You are allowed to add any cascade file to the repository

You are allowed to download the c++ code and make suitable changes according to your convienience
